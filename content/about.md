**whoami**
My name is Michael Schade and I am currently a security engineer for MITRE. I graduated from RIT and currently based out of the Boston area.

**What am I doing here?**
Honestly, I'm not sure......yet. I've wanted to run a "security blog" for a while and I think it's time to start.

**What is going to be posted?**
Great question. There is a lot of security tools/software/methods/etc that I haven't used before and would love to dive into (well at least start to learn it and have an idea of what each tool provides to the security world).

**Your about me says something about drones?**
Yep. I have really enjoyed getting into the drone space. I've been a techy kid for my whole life and have always wanted a drone. Last year (2020) I bought a DJI Spark as my introduction into the space. After using it a bunch and getting a handle of it, I decided it was time to upgrade to the DJI Mini 2. Upgrading video and picture quality to 4K really makes a difference....who would've thought!

**What do you do besides security?**
I'm really big into competitive Pokemon TCG. I spend a lot of time trying to get better and eventually qualify for the World Competition. Other than that, I spend time running around the dog park with our dog [Loki](https://www.instagram.com/loki_weenie) and planning our wedding with my fiance, Hannah.
